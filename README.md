## About The Project
Upon launching the project, the initial window features a menu bar at the top, housing several buttons. However, access to certain buttons is restricted until you log in.
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Before Log In</td>
    <td>Log In Button</td>
    <td>Logging In</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/Skylar-KyiShinKhant/Simple-POS/blob/Editing-files/pos-ss/Screenshot-1.png" width="350"></td>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/Skylar-KyiShinKhant/Simple-POS/blob/Editing-files/pos-ss/Screenshot-2.png" width="350"></td>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/Skylar-KyiShinKhant/Simple-POS/blob/Editing-files/pos-ss/Screenshot-3.png" width="350"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Upon successful login, the previously labeled __Log In__ button is now identified as __Log Out__, and access is granted to all other buttons.
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>"Log In" label has changed</td>
    <td>Buttons become active</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/Skylar-KyiShinKhant/Simple-POS/blob/Editing-files/pos-ss/Screenshot-4.png" width="500"></td>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/Skylar-KyiShinKhant/Simple-POS/blob/Editing-files/pos-ss/Screenshot-5.png" width="500"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Upon selecting the __Item__ button, a window will appear displaying a comprehensive list of items in stock, along with detailed information. In this interface, you have the ability to manipulate the data by creating, updating, deleting, or searching for items.

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Creating A New Stock</td>
    <td>Updating the data</td>
    <td>After Update</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/Skylar-KyiShinKhant/Simple-POS/blob/Editing-files/pos-ss/Screenshot-7.png" width="350"></td>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/Skylar-KyiShinKhant/Simple-POS/blob/Editing-files/pos-ss/Screenshot-8.png" width="350"></td>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/Skylar-KyiShinKhant/Simple-POS/blob/Editing-files/pos-ss/Screenshot-9.png" width="350"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Searching
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/Skylar-KyiShinKhant/Simple-POS/blob/Editing-files/pos-ss/Screenshot-10.png" width="350"></td>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/Skylar-KyiShinKhant/Simple-POS/blob/Editing-files/pos-ss/Screenshot-11.png" width="350"></td>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/Skylar-KyiShinKhant/Simple-POS/blob/Editing-files/pos-ss/Screenshot-12.png" width="350"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Similarly, when you click on the __Supplier__ button, a window will be presented, showcasing a list of suppliers with detailed information. Within this interface, you can perform various operations such as creating, updating, deleting, or searching for supplier-related data.
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/Skylar-KyiShinKhant/Simple-POS/blob/Editing-files/pos-ss/Screenshot-13.png" width="500"></td>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/Skylar-KyiShinKhant/Simple-POS/blob/Editing-files/pos-ss/Screenshot-14.png" width="500"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

The functionality of the __User Setting__ button operates in a similar fashion. However, when creating or updating new users, the window prompts for passwords and allows you to specify the buttons to which the new user will have access.
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/Skylar-KyiShinKhant/Simple-POS/blob/Editing-files/pos-ss/Screenshot-15.png" width="350"></td>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/Skylar-KyiShinKhant/Simple-POS/blob/Editing-files/pos-ss/Screenshot-16.png" width="350"></td>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/Skylar-KyiShinKhant/Simple-POS/blob/Editing-files/pos-ss/Screenshot-17.png" width="350"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Within the __Purchase__ button, editing rows is restricted. Nevertheless, when creating a new record for a purchase from a specific supplier, you have the option to view the details of the purchase by clicking on the plus sign located on very left column.
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Accessing Purchase Button</td>
    <td>Creating New Purchase</td>
    <td>Checking Details of the Purchase</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/Skylar-KyiShinKhant/Simple-POS/blob/Editing-files/pos-ss/Screenshot-18.png" width="350"></td>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/Skylar-KyiShinKhant/Simple-POS/blob/Editing-files/pos-ss/Screenshot-19.png" width="350"></td>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/Skylar-KyiShinKhant/Simple-POS/blob/Editing-files/pos-ss/Screenshot-20.png" width="350"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

The functionality of the __Sale__ button follows a similar pattern. When generating a new sale voucher, the __Change__ is automatically calculated based on the provided __Payment__, and likewise, the __Total__ and __Total Amount__ adjust dynamically according to the entered __SalePrice__ and __SaleQty__. Additionally, the __QtyOnHand__ is automatically populated when you press the ```Tab``` key after entering the __ItemName__.
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/Skylar-KyiShinKhant/Simple-POS/blob/Editing-files/pos-ss/Screenshot-21.png" width="500"></td>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/Skylar-KyiShinKhant/Simple-POS/blob/Editing-files/pos-ss/Screenshot-22.png" width="500"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

The __Item__ table will reflect changes as you purchase and sell goods, providing a dynamic overview of the updated inventory status.

Finally, the __Profit/Loss__ button allows you to assess the profit or loss incurred within a user-selected time period. Additionally, you have the capability to filter the results based on the __ItemName__.
<table>
  <tr>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/Skylar-KyiShinKhant/Simple-POS/blob/Editing-files/pos-ss/Screenshot-24.png" width="500"></td>
    <td><img src="https://github.com/Skylar-KyiShinKhant/Simple-POS/blob/Editing-files/pos-ss/Screenshot-25.png" width="500"></td>
  </tr>
</table>

Upon all of this, you can exit the program using either the __Exit__ button under the __File__ menu or by clicking the close (cross) icon located at the top right corner of the window.
